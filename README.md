## Project Overview: Stage 1

In this project we converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready application. At this point we designed the application to provide accessibility for screen readers and to respond on different sized screens.We also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users of this app.

### How to fire up this thing!!

1.When you download all the files that this project includes open command prompt (cmd)
2. Then type in cd "the path of the folder you just downloaded"
3.Then type py -m http.server 2000
4. After your server is running, visit the site: `http://localhost:2000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
